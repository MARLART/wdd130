            <h2>Learning on a Budget</h2>
            <p>
                When trying to learn something, it can feel overwhelming as there is so much information out there. The first place to start can be from recommendations from others. You should also consider your budget.

            <h2>No budget</h2>
            <p>If you can only afford to use free resources, you still have plenty of      options.
                <ol>
                    <li>Youtube videos. These vary in quality of information but can be very useful if you put the time into searching.</li>
                    <li>Library. Libraries are a great resource, if your local library does not have what you need, they may be able to source books from other libraries at low or no cost My own local library also gives me online access to ebooks, audiobooks, magazines and family history resources for free with my free membership. I can also use the computers and wifi on site for free.</li>
            
                    <li>Employer / Church sponsored learning. A large organisation  may offer opportunities to learn skills that are valued by that organisation. I have learned coaching skills, Te Reo Maori (Maori Language), and how to start a small business.</li>

            <h2>Small budget</h2>
            <p>When you can put aside a small amount of money to support your learning.
                Don't forget the free options as well.
                <ol>
                    <li>Community sponsored classes. These courses are run by community organisations or local libraries. They are taught by volunteers and usually charge a small fee to cover materials and expenses. They can be of inconsistent quality, depending on the volunteer teacher. They do have the advantage that have you set time aside to attend class (forced me time) and you interact with other learners.</li>
                     <li>Online training organisations such as datacamp and umedy. They also have sales at times with large discounts on their courses. I have generally found these courses to be of good quality. However as it is self - led learning so it is easy to stop working on the course when life gets busy.</li>

            <h2>Large budget</h2>
            <p>When you have a lot of money available or you are prepared to borrow so pay for your education. In this section, if you are borrowing to learn or require this course to improve your income, I would insure that the course will give you a qualification that is recognised in the country you wish to work in.
                <ol>
                    <li>Universities and Trade Schools. These will give you formal qualifications</li>
                    <li>Local training organisations: These organisations often specailise in a certain area eg beauty or computer game development.</li>
                    <Li>Online training organisations. Be careful here, will your money get you a recognised qualification or just give you a portfolio. </Li>
